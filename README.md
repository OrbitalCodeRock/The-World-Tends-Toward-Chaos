# The-World-Tends-Toward-Chaos
Made for Brackey's game jam 2021.2.
This game was my first game jam game, which I had one week to create!
All assets where made using Unity's(version 2020.3.16f1) default tools.
In order to run this game you can visit its itch.io page(https://orbitalrock.itch.io/the-world-tends-toward-chaos),
or you can download Unity Engine and create a folder to store all the files uploaded to github.
I recommend placing this folder where you plan to place your other unity project folders.
